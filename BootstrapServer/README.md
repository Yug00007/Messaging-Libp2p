This is a bootstrapping server for peers to form initial connnection, it would be managed by autoscaling kubernetes

Progress:
1. Finishing basic bootstrap node. (DONE!!!!)
2. Adding option to Store Bootstrap server's PeerID to "Main System" for accessing nodes. (PARTIAL DONE!!!) - Can be improved for CDN Type Relay Behaviour.
3. Possible transition to Golang or working on more networking part of nodes.
